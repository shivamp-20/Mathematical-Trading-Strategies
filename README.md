## Assignment 2

**Description:** First, The historical data of ^IXIC and ^NSEI indices had been downloded and did some preprocessing of data. Then, The lead-lag relationship between the two indices had been formed and observed that NSEI index was leading behind IXIC index using the correlation between the two. 
IXIC index had been used to optimize the parameters and then used them for NSEI index. After optimizing the parameters for the indicators, Buy and sell signals had been generated using all 3 indicators. Finally, Calculations for cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio and Max Drawdown for NSEI index using the Keltner channel strategy, Bollinger bands strategy and MACD had been done.


||MACD|Bollinger Bands|Keltner Channels|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Cumulative returns|15\.067 %|25\.046 %|14\.034 %|
|Sharpe Ratio|0\.1858|0\.2045|0\.4359|
|Max Drawdown|-31.411 %|-31.185%|-17.672 %|
