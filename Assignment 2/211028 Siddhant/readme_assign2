Firstly established a lead lag relationship between NSEI and NDAQ indices. Concluded that NSEI is leading and it can be used to predict NDAQ.
So NSEI is used to analyse using different indicators. Parameters of indices are optimised for better metric values. Finally, used the optimized parameters for trading NDAQ index. 
To get optimum returns using
Keltner Channel strategy-atr period value is taken to be 16 and ema period value is taken to be 25. 
Bollinger Bands-The factor to be multiplied comes out to standard deviation comes out to be 0.1.
MACD-The setting is kept to be (15,50,10) to get maximum returns.
