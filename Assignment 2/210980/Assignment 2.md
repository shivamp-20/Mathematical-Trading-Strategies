Mathematical Trading Strategies

Assignment 2

Description: First, I downloaded the historical data of ^IXIC and ^NSEI indices and did some preprocessing of data. Then, I found the lead-lag relationship between the two indices and observed that NSEI index was leading behind IXIC index using the correlation between the two. 
I used IXIC index to optimize the parameters and then used them for NSEI index. After optimizing the parameters for the indicators, I generated buy and sell signals using all 3 indicators. Finally, I calculated cumulative returns, Sharpe ratio and Max Drawdown for NSEI index using the Keltner channel strategy, Bollinger bands strategy and MACD.


||MACD|Bollinger Bands|Keltner Channels|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|Cumulative returns|15\.067 %|25\.046 %|14\.034 %|
|Sharpe Ratio|0\.1858|0\.2045|0\.4359|
|Max Drawdown|-31.411 %|-31.185%|-17.672 %|
