# Description

I have worked on NASDAQ and NSE indexes from 2010 to 2023. In this period we find both indexes to be highly correlated (~0.95) and best lead-lag acc. to the data comes out to be 12 days. 

Next I have implemented all 3 MACD, Bollinger and Keltner Channel, creating buy/sell signal and finally getting to follwing metrics.

 # 
   
|Metrics|MACD|Bollinger Band|Keltner Channel|
|---|---|---|---|
|Cummulative Returns|106\.18%|118\.25%|177\.92%|
|Sharpe Ratio|10\.52|8\.56|8\.15|
|Max Drawdown|-23\.86%|-23\.21%|-30\.81%|
